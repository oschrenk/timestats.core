# README #

I use [Minco](http://www.celmaro.com/minco/) for tracking my time I spent on various projects. Currently I use the file appender for creating cvs files containing entries for each task.

This project collects parses these entries and offers a JAVA API to create statistics.

I have also created a simple [command line utility](http://github.com/oschrenk/timestats.ui.cmd) using the API.
